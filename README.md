## What We Do
### The Problem
You’ve got your suitcase open on your bed, your packing list scribbled on a notepad, the weather app open on your phone and your friends texting you the top attractions to hit on your upcoming trip. Outside of the more crucial aspects of trip planning - booking your flight, hotel and rental car - it can be a real hassle to keep track of everything else. 

### Our Solution
We tie up all those loose ends in a single platform that houses everything you’ll need to make your next trip a success - from suggesting activities to providing up to date weather information and a home for your all-in-one packing list. 

## How We Do It
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Materialize
* Python/Django/Postgresql
* Heroku
* Google Places API
* DarkSky API
